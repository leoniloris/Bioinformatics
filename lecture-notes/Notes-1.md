* Vein blood has a differrent ionization comparing with the arterial one


## Contents
* Carbonile and NH are(in general) the main responsible for backbone folding.
    - Because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, carbonyl compounds often have resonance structures which affect their reactivity. This relative electronegativity draws electron density away from carbon, increasing the bond's polarity, therefore making carbon an electrophile 
* Ramachandran HeatMap
* fenda maior/menor dna
* Proline brakes a-helix but with multiple, it can generate a new protein
(we have helix, leaves and loops)
* loops (al√ßas) in general are flexible, conveying specificity of tissues .
* Chaperona protein.

## Ideas
* FCNN for important expression areas in proteins(2d, 3d, 4d is the best??).
* Multi-layered Seeelf-attention for the former.
