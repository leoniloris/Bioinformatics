* Protein Data Bank - PDB
* Vein blood has a differrent ionization comparing with the arterial one


## Contents
* Carbonile and NH are(in general) the main responsible for backbone folding.
* Ramachandran HeatMap
* fenda maior/hmenor dna
* Proline brakes a-helix but with multiple, it can generate a new protein
(we have helix, leaves and loops)
* loops (al√ßas) in general are flexible, conveying specificity of tissues .
* Chaperona protein.


## Take a look 
- What is Chrystalization of an enzyme.
- Production of protein in yeast.


## Ideas
* FCNN for important expression areas in proteins(2d, 3d, 4d is the best??).
* Multi-layered Seeelf-attention for the former.
